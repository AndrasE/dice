## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

This project was part of my self-study with the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a> gang! ğŸ‘¯ Creating two random numbers between 1-6 accordingply to the outcome displaying and image for user highlighting the winner. (basic math ğŸ¥²). I also added some a second of suspense before. Button refreshes the page and game restarts! ğŸš©
  
Take care, code safe! ğŸ’»

<br>

## Run ğŸš€
As its only uses HTML, CSS you wont need much:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrasE/firsty
$ cd PROJECTNAME
$ open index.html
```
