## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This project was part of my self-study with  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a>. Creating two random numbers between 1-6 accordingly to the outcomes displaying images for user highlighting the winner. I also added some @medias for mobile and a second of suspense before announcing the winner. Button refreshes the page and game restarts! ðŸš©


## Run ðŸš€
Its only HTML, CSS you wont need much:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrasE/firsty
$ cd PROJECTNAME
$ open index.html
```
