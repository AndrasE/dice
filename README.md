  A simple dicegame with JavaScript
</h3>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This project was part of my self-study on **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp)**. 

Creating two random numbers between 1-6 accordingly to the outcomes displaying images for user highlighting the winner. I also added some @medias for mobile and a second of suspense before announcing the winner. Button refreshes the page and game restarts!

## Run ðŸš€
Its only HTML, CSS you wont need much:

`
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrasE/firsty
`

`
$ cd PROJECTNAME
`

`
$ open index.html
`
